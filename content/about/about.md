After 4 years, everything seems to slow down, like the gentle breeze of early summer. So, hankou.com began.<br> 

This year's summer did not come abruptly. Without the hot and humid days, it seemed to lack charm. <br>

I bought a few paper books, so that I would not feel too tired when flipping through them.<br>

Writing is not a difficult thing. As long as you follow the steps, you can pile up a mountain. <br>

Moreover, writing articles in the way of writing code is more efficient, and you don't need to think too much to write long articles. <br>

It started from such a long day.
