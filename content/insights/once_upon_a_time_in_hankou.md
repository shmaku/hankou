Wuhan consists of three towns, namely Hanyang, Wuchang and Hankou. 

Hanyang and Hankou face each other across the Han River. Among the three towns, Hanyang was established the earliest. Since the Tang Dynasty, Hanyang County has begun to govern the affairs in Hubei. Wuchang and Hankou face each other across the river. Wuchang originally referred to the current Ezhou area. After the Yuan Dynasty, it was precisely pointed to the current location of Wuchang City.

Hankou refers to a vast riverside area sandwiched between the Yangtze River and the Han River. Hankou was established the latest. It was not until the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty that Hanyang County set up a patrol inspection office to manage Hankou Town, which was about 480 years ago. 

Hankou is different from Hanyang and Wuchang. Hankou is not an independent administrative division. Hankou includes three administrative districts: Jiangan District, Jianghan District and Qiaokou District. Jianghan District has the smallest area and the largest population density. It concentrates the most important financial institutions and has the highest per capita GDP.

The average annual temperature in Hankou is 18°C. The hottest months are July and August, with the highest temperature reaching 38°C. December and January are the coldest, with an average temperature of around 5°C. March and April in spring and October and November in autumn are the most comfortable months in Hankou, when all the parks are blooming with beautiful colors. The weather is pleasant and makes people feel relaxed.

Hanjiang River, also known as Hanshui River, has its source in Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province, flows through southern Shaanxi Province, runs through northwestern Hubei Province, and flows into the Yangtze River in Wuhan. It is 1,577 kilometers long.

The main stream of Hanjiang River is navigable from Yangxian County in Hanzhong, with a navigable distance of 1,342 kilometers.

Since the end of the Ming Dynasty, Hanshui River has become an important waterway for north-south trade. Goods that need to be transported to the north, mainly tea, are transported to Hankou by land and then shipped to the north. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, around the late 17th century, the Hankou Inspection Office was moved from Chongxinfang in Hanyang to Hankou across the Hanshui River. It can be seen that the commercial development of Hankou has entered a new era.
