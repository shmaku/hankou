#In the North Sea there is a Peng, whose wings are like clouds hanging from the sky... 

**A speck of dust wandering in the boundless universe**

There is a story that will unfold here. If you have **patience**, I will tell you the story.<br>

What I thought was going on before, now seems not to be so natural.<br>
Only when you meet again and again, you can see it more **clearly**.<br>
