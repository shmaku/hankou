The immortal who rode the yellow crane has long since departed,<br>
Only the Yellow Crane Tower stands here still.<br>
The yellow crane, once gone, has never returned,<br>
For a thousand years, the white clouds idly drift on.<br>
In the clear river's view, Hanyang's trees stand distinct,<br>
On Parrot Isle, lush grasses grow thick and green.<br>
Where is my homeland at sunset?<br>
The river's mist and waves stir sorrow in the soul.<br>


This poem is considered one of the greatest in Chinese literature, known for its historical depth, lyrical beauty, and the poet's poignant expression of longing for home. The Yellow Crane Tower itself is a famous landmark in Wuhan, and the poem draws upon legends associated with it. The first two couplets evoke a sense of loss and the passage of time, while the latter half shifts to a vivid description of the surrounding landscape before returning to the theme of homesickness.<br>
According to legend, when the great poet Li Bai climbed the Yellow Crane Tower, he intended to compose a poem of his own. However, upon seeing Cui Hao's 'Yellow Crane Tower' inscribed on the wall and reading it, he was so deeply moved that he felt no words could surpass itâ€”and so, he laid down his brush.<br>
Over the centuries, Cui Hao's Yellow Crane Tower has endured as one of the most celebrated masterpieces in Chinese poetry.
