It’s worth the trip. He checked the travel time on his map and replied to Boss Zhao:\n“I’m on my way now. I’ll get to your place around 1:02 PM.”\n“Okay, I’ll go charge my car then. Let me know when you arrive.”\nLin Song pulled his car into the parking garage of the Donghe Center and was surprised to see only a single Peugeot 308, a model that had been out of production for years. It completely lacked the aura of a “landlord.” Lin Song could only sigh.\nBoss Zhao was sitting in his charging Tesla, blasting the AC. Seeing Lin Song wave, he quickly got out and treated him to a cafeteria-style meal where you pay by weight.

The current material prices had already surged to a fifty-year high, and Boss Zhao’s purchasing price was already at the industry’s rock bottom. However, he felt the current grade of materials was a bit lacking and wanted Lin Song to provide him with some samples. Lin Song said to him:\n“A fifty-year business cycle.

I’ve been getting my hair cut by him for almost ten years. You think I don’t know how much it costs?\nSeeing the silent Lin Song, the young man washing his hair perhaps realized he was a regular customer of Tony’s and didn’t say anything more, just diligently washed his hair. As if to apologize for his earlier verbal offense, he even shampooed Lin Song’s hair twice. Lin Song washed his own hair every day, regardless of the season, and his scalp never itched.\nIn front of the barber’s mirror, Lin Song fiddled with the thinning hair on top of his head. It was then that he understood. The young man who had washed his hair earlier didn’t think he couldn’t afford the 49 yuan fee. The young man’s meaning was probably that the amount of hair on his head was no longer worth the 49 yuan price of a haircut.\n",
