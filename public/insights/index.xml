      <description>喻老师的迎新年音乐会，充满了再次回到希望的田野上的喜气洋洋。
唱歌的男中音，挺拔着微胖的身姿，声线控制得温润圆滑，深情地翘首眺望遥远的故乡。
超过130岁年纪的男女声二重唱，临摹着他们年少时磁带封面上偶像的模样，举手投足间一丝不苟。
这是即将到来的新年的打卡签到，不同时代的色彩轮回着炫彩的画风。
股神从头到尾坐在第一排的桌子边上，挥舞着手中的五彩塑料拍手器，引导表演者站在聚光灯的最中央，摇头摆手，棕色的变色眼镜丝毫没有显露出疲惫的时候。
两个半小时以后，14岁的未来歌唱家，挨着外婆安静地刷着自己的手机。
排在近三个小时后出场演唱的学员不仅仅是带着嗓子从远道回来，他们是全副盛装地登台。各式礼服，少数民族服饰轮番登场。
唱到情深处，眼睛里有光，欢喜忧伤溢于表扬，情绪拉满，倾诉着他们富丽的人生。
浓妆重彩的欢声笑语，焕彩生机又一春。
“喻老师美不美？”
“美！”
林松路过便利店买了一杯豆浆，他认为这家的热豆浆浓郁得像牛奶，喝起来可以黏舌头。记得姐姐在蒸饭后淘下来的米汤，即使加了很多的白砂糖，也还是不够浓稠，喝了半壶以后嗓子就会发腻。
拎着豆浆到德华楼买了一碗热干面，对下面的嫂子强调，不要酸豆角。叮嘱煎鸡蛋的阿姨，煎了两个不用模具的散漫鸡蛋。半熟，用筷子一尖，溏心就流出，正好。
已经是隆冬的天气，德华楼门口垂挂的厚皮革帘子也挡不住寒风往店里面灌。
林松在最里边角落上找了一个空位置，那里充斥着炉子散发出的温暖。吃完早餐就坐在那里开始刷手机。
钉在墙上的纸巾盒子上印着“节约用纸”。大爷，大妈每次都会在提示语的提示下，连续抽足一天里上厕所的用量。是的，他们总是记得节约自己家里的用纸。
完全不用担心有人笑话你多抽的那十几张纸巾，你也不用邪眼藐着我，我又不认识你。
城市里面的狗出门，主人都要在狗脖子上栓一根绳子牵在手里。林松小时候会在村里的狗尾巴上捆一串鞭炮，点燃后，让狗子可以跑得飞快。让狗子困惑的是，它跑得越快，炸裂的鞭炮跟得越紧。被炸得魂飞魄散的狗子跑得再远，也认得回家的路。
马路对面的大润发越来越来越像楼下季佳荟里的盒马，他们共同摧毁着过往二十年彼此的卖场生意，也许不仅仅是过去，而且正在毁掉着是未来。嗯，用狭隘的视角展望未来，未来又会是什么呢？
“莫名其妙”往往是理解能力不够或对某些事物不具备理解能力的另一种表达。
伟大的艺术只曾在于那些衣食无忧且具有创造力的人的身上。
在地下二层电梯口的按键旁，歪七竖八写着： “天将大任于斯（是）人也，必先劳其劲（筋）骨，饿其体服（肤），苦其心志（错了位置）！😊（行拂乱其所为）” 跟在这段话的后面是大一倍的字号，看起来是想写“狗屄”，两个字，但是他不会写。于是涂改几笔后写成了“狗屁”， 小一倍的字号跟着后面写：“快跑”
这也许是为什么可以在手机里看到那么多的假新闻？一段稀疏平常的课文，每一句都写了一个错别字，跟进的评论粗俗不堪。如此这般，认识世界的方式必然是乱七八糟。于是乎，最贴合心思的，就是那些谬误层出不穷的新闻。
电梯间的门楣上贴了一张新的红纸。今年的冬天，已经过了冬至，还不算冷。
林松打开了收音机，听着快乐的黑人律动摇摆音乐，想起那些让人烦心的琐碎事情，他怎么也快乐不起来。是谁说的，律动统一天下。虽然看起来那么的有道理，但是，那么的无济于事。
我们常常通过讨好别人来愉悦自己。特别是当孤独地行走在冰冷的雨夜，就会期待遇到一个带着暖手宝的女朋友。直到有一天，互相取悦发展成了一种非常重要的社交属性。你快乐，所以我快乐。再后来，仅仅取悦自己反倒成了一种反社会的标签，像狗皮膏药一样贴在赤膊的背上。

      <description>Sister Tony always has a heavy hand when cutting hair. The electric clippers start from the nape of the neck, pushing upward right against the scalp. You can feel the cold touch of the metal; it’s nothing if not clean and sharp. After she finishes buzzing, she politely asks Lin Song, &amp;ldquo;Is this length okay?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s fine.&amp;rdquo; You’ve already shaved off the hair on the left side; whether it&amp;rsquo;s okay or not, that&amp;rsquo;s how it is.</description>

      <title>The Man Sunbathing at the Crossroads</title>

      <description>He stood there at the intersection, motionless, facing the center of the crossroads no matter which way the traffic light turned green. The morning sun shone on his slightly weathered cheek, illuminating his faint smile. It turned out he was standing there to bask in the sun. When the tall buildings ahead blocked the sun as it moved from east to west, he would walk to the opposite corner where the sunlight still reached, and continue his sunbathing.</description>

      <description>Following days of gloom, the sun finally revealed itself in the morning.
Just past 8:00 AM, the Starbucks barista began scrubbing the ground at the entrance with a bucket of water. Wearing only a green short-sleeved T-shirt, his thin frame faced the north wind, yet he seemed impervious to the cold. A slightly chubby girl sat leaning on a chair brushing her teeth; the shop hadn&amp;rsquo;t opened yet, and the U-lock still hung on the handle of the glass door.</description>

      <title>Serious Writing: The Highest Form of Intellectual Discipline</title>

      <description>Writing is never about you. It is about whether you can use words to change the world—even if it&amp;rsquo;s just a small corner of the minds of a few key people. This may sound cold, but it is the most authentic rule of academic writing.
Your teachers are not your real readers; they read your work out of obligation. The real-world reader owes you nothing. Similarly, the clichéd goal of &amp;ldquo;filling a knowledge gap&amp;rdquo; pales in comparison to the reality of infinite knowledge expansion.</description>

      <description>There was dew under the eaves in the early morning. Disturbed by the waving hand of the breakfast stall owner, a fly fell into a freshly filled bowl of doufunao (tofu pudding). The owner&amp;rsquo;s hands were quick. The spoon, which had just been used for white sugar, deftly scooped the fly out and flicked it onto the sidewalk. She then smoothly pushed the bowl toward an old man who had just paid.</description>

      <description>The morning glow emerged. Standing at the intersection, he saw the rooftops of distant high-rises, bathed in golden sunlight. Up early, Lin Song pulled a thick fleece vest over his shirt and went out to wander the streets. In the vegetable market, people were hurriedly buying groceries. Some rode electric bikes to take their children to school, others queued in cars for the commute to work or delivered goods to businesses.</description>

      <description>After a decade of fluctuations, the Shanghai Composite Index has once again touched the 4,000-point mark.
The Dow Jones Index has hit a historic high. The UK&amp;rsquo;s FTSE Index has hit a historic high. Japan&amp;rsquo;s Nikkei Index has hit a 34-year high. Global stock market indices saw an overall increase of 9.1% in the first half of the year, setting a new record.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Fasting.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Level 1 Care.&amp;rdquo; These were rather stimulating terms.
On the first day of the &amp;ldquo;Golden September, Silver October&amp;rdquo; peak season, Lin Song checked himself into a hospital bed on the fourteenth floor of the Houhu campus. The lights in the ward were turned off just after 8 PM, but it was impossible to sleep. He closed his eyes, pulled the covers up to his shoulders, and forced himself to try.</description>

      <description>Lin Song felt as if his sky had caved in.
Ordinarily, almost no one worries that the sky might one day collapse. Everyone understands that in this world, there are always people taller than themselves who will be the first to prop up that falling sky. On a leisurely holiday, lying on the park grass and gazing up at the sky, the wind is gentle, the sun is beautiful, and the sky has not caved in.</description>

      <description>The gods always protect those who peacefully endure hardship. As for those who unfortunately suffer calamity, it can only be said that their own fate is to blame, not that the gods failed to protect them.
The above sentiment was a conclusion reached by Su Dongpo and his family as they journeyed down the river through the Three Gorges. He believed that if a man cannot control his body and mind, he cannot control his soul.</description>

      <description>The sun provides the Earth with energy, but it is the monsoon that determines our environment. Whether it brings scorching drought or favorable rains, the monsoon arrives as promised, cycling tirelessly, year after year.
If capital is the sun of the market, then consensus is its monsoon. Capital is the fundamental force that drives the market, but only when its participants reach some form of consensus can a real trend take shape.</description>

      <description>It was another heart-pounding Monday morning.
At 11:11 AM, the ChiNext board touched 2782 points, a new high for the past three years. Nearly a full year had passed since the last wave of public euphoria, and this time, the revelry had already lasted for two months. For the past three weeks, it had been a topic of hopeful conversation for everyone, regardless of whether they followed the market.
Some sat in the shade of a tree, dreaming of the next new high; others, in their air-conditioned rooms, quietly reduced their positions.</description>

      <description>Even as Wuhan’s weather entered the Chushu (End of Heat) solar term, the sweltering heat remained unbearable. The cicadas in the trees, having chirped through the entire summer, now sounded faint and weary.
The scorching sun, high in the sky, was obscured by a thick blanket of mackerel-scale clouds, and the world instantly dimmed. Lin Song quickened his pace, planning to take advantage of the shade to slip under the overpass.</description>

      <description>Tuesday is members&amp;rsquo; day at the Total gas station. If you go on this day, you can save a few dimes per liter, and the station also gives you a few discount coupons to use for your next fill-up.
Lin Song hadn&amp;rsquo;t driven all day, but to avoid missing today&amp;rsquo;s deal, he decided to make a trip to Total after the sun went down.
After filling up his Peugeot 508 and parking it in the underground garage, Lin Song sat in the car and scrolled through his phone for a while.</description>

      <title>Worse Than a Cold: Life’s Helplessness</title>

      <description>Early on a weekend morning, Lin Song had to go to Gaoqiao Fifth Road to pick up some goods.
He had received the call from the freight yard on Thursday notifying him the shipment had arrived. He had delayed for a day; thankfully, there weren&amp;rsquo;t many heavy trucks on the Third Ring Road on a Saturday.
On the Gusao Shu interchange viaduct, on the ramp turning from the Airport Expressway toward Gutian Second Road, a black Volkswagen tailgated Lin Song&amp;rsquo;s Peugeot 508.</description>

      <description>He hadn&amp;rsquo;t checked the mailbox in his building&amp;rsquo;s entryway for a long time. Remembering that an important piece of mail was supposed to arrive recently, Lin Song rummaged through a miscellaneous box in his bookcase and was relieved to find the mailbox key still there.
Three days ago, Lin Song had peered through the mail slot, scouting it out. There appeared to be an EMS envelope inside. But he had long since lost the habit of carrying keys, so he didn&amp;rsquo;t know for sure what was in there.</description>

      <description>Everyone has their own &amp;ldquo;soul breakfast.&amp;rdquo;
For Lin Song, it’s pan-fried buns, which must be paired with two fried eggs. If a breakfast shop only serves braised eggs, Lin Song considers them insincere.
Sharing a table with Lin Song were a young daughter and her earnestly instructing mother. The daughter had wanted pan-fried buns; the mother had ordered steamed dumplings. When the girl saw the pan-fried buns in Lin Song&amp;rsquo;s bowl, a look of disappointment crossed her face, as she had none.</description>

      <description>The shopping mall had set up temporary stalls in the open space by Entrance 3.
&amp;ldquo;Special Clearance on Books,&amp;rdquo; 9.9 yuan/jin (approx. 500g): The Encyclopedia of Healthy Recipes, A Guide to Food Pairings and Prohibitions. &amp;ldquo;Children&amp;rsquo;s Book Clearance,&amp;rdquo; 20 yuan/jin: Encyclopedia of Chinese Geography, Andersen&amp;rsquo;s Fairy Tales, Calabash Brothers. &amp;ldquo;Novel Clearance,&amp;rdquo; 22 yuan/jin: Nezha: Past Stories of the Three Realms, The Details of Law, The Grave Robbers&amp;rsquo; Chronicles.
Lin Song circled the bookstall three and a half times, scanning the titles one by one.</description>

      <description>An important sign that summer is about to end is that by Saturday morning, the food delivery platforms have eased up on their promotions.
Lin Song parked his car in the underground garage. Before turning off the engine, he glanced at the time on the display: ten past five. Still enough time to make dinner.
&amp;ldquo;Fingerprint error!&amp;rdquo;
The sharp alert from the smart lock startled Lin Song. Every time he opened the door, he was very careful to cover the sensor completely with his thumb.</description>

      <description>Venting is a base emotion. Lin Song dislikes it when people get forceful and aggressive in their interactions. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because, over the past few years, he has been so worn down by such overbearing attitudes that he feels his own lung capacity has diminished.
At noon, after dropping off Xiao Lin at the train station, he went to a client&amp;rsquo;s office to settle a payment. Coming down from the elevated departure level of the station, Lin Song began to wonder how he would kill the next two hours until his client&amp;rsquo;s office opened at two.</description>

      <description>As expected, the orange high-temperature warning arrived on schedule, like a gilded invitation for the entire city to partake in a grand sauna. For all those not required to clock in at an office, the strategy for escaping the heat was strikingly uniform: flock to the shopping mall, that modern oasis of steel and concrete, to righteously share its free air conditioning.
The sun had just crossed the horizon, the morning light yet to fully dispel the city&amp;rsquo;s slumber, when figures already began to gather at the mall&amp;rsquo;s entrance at half-past nine.</description>

      <description>At the intersection beneath the overpass, the road surface, worn out from years of neglect, was once riddled with potholes. Drivers who frequented this route would instinctively steer around the sunken manhole covers to avoid scraping the undercarriage of their cars. After the summer rains, the eroded roadbed, repeatedly crushed by heavy vehicles, became even more bumpy and unbearable.
Last week, the intersection was repaved with fresh asphalt, the depressions were filled, and a new crosswalk was painted at the widest point.</description>

      <description>For 30 consecutive days, the maximum temperature in Wuhan has exceeded 38°C (100.4°F). For a month, the high temperatures have had perfect attendance, never absent, never late.
In the sweltering heat of July, some chose to escape to southeastern Hubei. But who would have known that deep in the Dabie Mountains, it was just as historically hot as Wuhan? During the day, swirling clouds of mist felt like a steamer; at night, air conditioning was a must.</description>

      <description>On a Saturday afternoon, the gym is at its quietest. Sunlight slants through the massive floor-to-ceiling windows, casting bright patches on the dark gray rubber floor. The air is a mixture of scents—the cold, metallic smell of the equipment, a faint hint of disinfectant, and the subtle trace of evaporated sweat. The weekday evening hustle is gone, replaced by an off-peak tranquility, as if a soothing rest note has been placed at the end of a long, strenuous week.</description>

      <description>It was sunny when he set out. After crossing the Dabie Mountains, the clouds in the sky began to thicken. As he approached Fuyang, a few raindrops even splattered against the windshield.
In the past, when traveling on inter-provincial expressways, you had to swap your IC toll card at each provincial border, settling the toll for the completed section before starting anew in the next province. Every business trip left Lin Song with a pile of toll receipts to file for reimbursement.</description>

      <description>At just past five in the morning, the breakfast shop behind the station was already open for business. The young man frying buns looked up with surprise as Lin Song walked past his storefront.
Lin Song had to make a trip to Fuyang this morning for his first meeting with a client. To avoid getting sunburned during the long drive, he had deliberately worn a long-sleeved shirt. He had planned to buy four buns from the Kechen Baozi Shop for breakfast, but when he saw that a single bun from this shop was bigger than two from the Dehua Restaurant, he quickly told the owner that two meat buns and one vegetable bun would be enough.</description>

      <description>Surprisingly, there was no one seeking refuge from the heat in the entrance passage of the Shiqiao Metro Station. As Lin Song descended on the escalator, he could feel that the air conditioning in the station seemed to be off. On the concourse level, in front of the Zhou Hei Ya duck neck stall, a notice was pasted on the bright yellow construction barrier: &amp;ldquo;Construction Hazard, Do Not Approach.&amp;rdquo;
Today&amp;rsquo;s breakfast was reganmian.</description>

      <description>Summer vacation was in full swing, and grandparents had become the main force in childcare. The grandmothers&amp;rsquo; specialty was taking the little ones to the mall to cool off. They&amp;rsquo;d find an open area with a large TV, and the old and young would sit down in rows. The TV played old cartoons on a loop.
A film like Godzilla vs. Kong held no appeal for them. The children lost interest after a couple of glances, and the elderly had no idea who the monsters were fighting, much less why.</description>

      <description>In October of 1996, Lin Song and his colleagues went to Zhengzhou on a business trip. The weather was cool and pleasant. After finishing their official duties, they decided to use the spare time before their return journey to visit the Songshan Shaolin Temple. By then, nearly fifteen years had passed since Lin Song, in the prime of his youth, had watched Jet Li&amp;rsquo;s Shaolin Temple.
Lin Song remembered it was a weekday.</description>

      <description>He left the house too early, his morning appetite not yet awakened. Lin Song went to the Dehua Restaurant to get two orders of xiao long bao and two fried eggs, drizzling some light soy sauce over the yolks. He took the food with him in the car, ready to comfort his hollow stomach whenever hunger decided to strike.
In the summer, it seems human skin can perform photosynthesis. As long as you give it some water, you can go all day without thinking about food.</description>

      <description>At noon, Chen Peisi’s star power failed to draw a larger audience for his film, The Stage. Screening Room No. 2, located near the ticket check, is one of the larger theaters in the cinema. Even so, there were fewer people in the audience than there were opera fans in the movie itself. After accounting for the couple who walked out midway, the vast theater felt even more sparse.
The film&amp;rsquo;s original score left little impression, mainly because The Stage is set against the backdrop of the Peking Opera classic Farewell My Concubine, and thus, most of the film’s music was occupied by traditional opera melodies.</description>

      <description>It was a strange day; no matter where he sat, Lin Song could smell a thick odor of sweat. It was a summer smell he knew well. Back in middle school, he’d wear the same jersey for an entire afternoon of ball games, and after practice, he’d just toss it in the equipment room, only to put it on again the next afternoon. It was an age of utter indifference.</description>

      <description>The best legacy a restaurant that has closed for good can leave to a shopping mall is its wide assortment of tables and chairs. The vacated stalls can&amp;rsquo;t find new tenants right away, so they become temporary leisure areas. On this hot summer day, in an air-conditioned mall, as long as there are enough seats, there will be enough customers coming to escape the heat.
The grandpas and grandmas, brothers and sisters who come to enjoy the cool, bring their cell phones and occupy every empty seat.</description>

      <description>After raining for half the night, it finally stopped. The east-facing window did not greet an early-rising sun. The air was clear and transparent. Along the horizon, thick cumulonimbus clouds curled, letting a faint morning glow seep through.
Room 7 on the sixth floor is being renovated. Debris from dismantled old cabinets litters the elevator. You have to watch your step coming in and out to avoid a nail. Just after 8:30 a.</description>

      <description>As night fell, Wuhan, having passed the &amp;ldquo;Minor Heat&amp;rdquo; solar term, was somehow less scorching.
The clouds in the sky were always piled thick, clump after clump, like sun umbrellas, blocking the sun from time to time. Occasionally, at dusk, the heavens would bestow a stingy shower, taming some of the fierce heat of the scalding asphalt roads.
The shelves outside the HotMaxx discount store were diligently displaying all kinds of beer.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re slightly tipsy, how can you refuse a chat with a talkative taxi driver?
I vaguely remember the last time was in Hong Kong. I had left a Bob Dylan concert early, otherwise I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have made it to the Mount Davis Youth Hostel before its reception closed.
The old driver asked, bewildered, why I chose to stay on the mountain. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s cheap there.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about the same in the city, there are hotels everywhere.</description>

      <description>Friday afternoon was utterly exhausting. The client&amp;rsquo;s warehouse closed at five, so there was no time to deliver the prepped goods. After a quick discussion with the client, they agreed to a Saturday morning delivery. One final confirmation: yes, the client&amp;rsquo;s warehouse accepts deliveries on Saturdays.
Coming out of the underground garage, Lin Song slipped on his sunglasses while waiting at a red light to make a U-turn.
The barrier for the U-turn lane extended nearly to the middle of the intersection.</description>

      <description>The Wuhan Meteorological Observatory upgraded its high-temperature warning to a red alert, with some streets reaching over 41°C (106°F). Lin Song felt like a frog being boiled in water; after being cooked for so long, he had learned to swim in it.
On days when the sun beat down, Lin Song would go out wearing a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and a hat, after smearing a layer of sunscreen on his face and the back of his neck.</description>

      <description>Even in the sweltering heat of midsummer, there can be cool mornings. The early-rising sun was blocked by the tall buildings to the east. In the community&amp;rsquo;s courtyard, a through-draft blew from north to south, wandering between the apartment buildings and the small woods.
Though it was long past his usual breakfast time, Lin Song wasn&amp;rsquo;t hungry at all. All told, sixteen hours had passed since last night&amp;rsquo;s dinner. Perhaps due to the heat, he still had no appetite.</description>

      <description>Lin Song believes he is the most ill-tempered man in all of Hankou.
But living in Wuhan, what can you do? The winter is cold enough to freeze your scalp; the summer is hot enough to agitate you from the inside out. As for flying into these nameless rages, Lin Song feels it&amp;rsquo;s completely beyond his control.
He remembers Wu Meili once telling him:

&amp;ldquo;I gave up a stable career to pursue a completely unknown goal,&amp;rdquo; he said.

Twenty years, 405 races, 141 championship titles—eight drivers&amp;rsquo; championships, six constructors&amp;rsquo; championships. He was the longest-serving team principal in Red Bull&amp;rsquo;s history.
An era has completely ended.

      <description>Lin Song had absolutely no intention of going out.
Even in the morning, the coolest part of the day, the glaring sunlight outside his curtains made him feel an invisible wave of heat.
Summer is like that. You never feel hungry. Even if your empty stomach rumbles, you have no desire to eat. A couple of sips of water make you feel better.
But not wanting to eat is just an illusion created by the sweltering heat.</description>

      <description>They say today is the end of the world. And so, the 39-degree heat of Wuhan&amp;rsquo;s summer arrived especially early.
The weather in Wuhan today: 39 degrees Celsius. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask. Wuhan&amp;rsquo;s weather is only ever allowed to be 39 degrees. Even if the sun in the sky were to fall on your face, the temperature would still only be permitted to be 39 degrees.
At a time like this, if you dared to go out under the sun and lick a utility pole by the road, you&amp;rsquo;d hear a sizzle, and your tongue would be seared.</description>

This past Tuesday, he had finished his barista course at the training school. After the exam next Friday, he would receive his graduation certificate.</description>

      <description>The sky this summer was exceptionally blue. In this often-gray city, there are always a few days in the year perfect for looking up at the sky.
As the sun set, a crescent moon would appear simultaneously in the southern sky. It looked white and tender, with a kind of delicate posture that Lin Song found endearing.
Lin Song had always loved summer vacation. The break was long enough, a full two months.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know what material they&amp;rsquo;re coated with, but they are entirely jet-black and haven&amp;rsquo;t shown a speck of rust all these years.
At first, Manager Wang from the property management department told Lin Song that the two statues at the main entrance were Qilin. So, Lin Song called them Qilin. In any case, Lin Song had never seen a living Qilin, and Manager Wang was always exceptionally serious and responsible in his work.</description>

Lin Song had a good, long sleep, a full ten hours of it. It was only after waking that he felt a chill on his back; the blanket had been bunched up under his stomach at some point. The air conditioner had been running all night, which let him sleep soundly—perhaps because he had been so exhausted the day before.</description>

He was only an hour later than Kobe. Call it the time difference between Los Angeles and Hankou, Lin Song thought, forgiving himself as he bathed in the cool, crisp midsummer morning breeze.
The sign of the corner ice cream shop at the mall was lit up day and night, as if determined to adorn the city&amp;rsquo;s summer nights, which were soon to become scorching hot.</description>

It took Lin Song a full hour to inch his way from Yindun Street, west of Hankou Railway Station, to Jinsui Street on the east side. The square in front of the station was gridlocked with countless ride-share cars.
Lin Song parked in the underground garage and then went to the bus stop across the road.</description>

      <description>The streetlights were already out, but the sky had yet to fully brighten. After the summer solstice, the days grow shorter, the nights longer.
It had been a long time since Lin Song had woken up this early. If he didn&amp;rsquo;t leave right away, he would never check off all the items on his to-do list.
From the kitchen, he could hear the pitter-patter of what might be rain striking the awning outside.</description>

      <description>Lin Song&amp;rsquo;s cat is named Xiao Xiao, from the word xiaosǎ, meaning &amp;ldquo;dashing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;free-spirited.&amp;rdquo;
This British Shorthair was a gift from the &amp;ldquo;Cat Auntie&amp;rdquo; in Building 7 of his apartment complex. The Cat Auntie keeps seventeen cats. Xiao Xiao and his three siblings were born to the same mother, and he was the runt of the litter.
When the Cat Auntie placed Xiao Xiao in Lin Song&amp;rsquo;s hands, she confidently told him it was a female.</description>

      <description>After a four-month shutdown, the Baocheng Street Night Market was finally open again.
&amp;ldquo;Zhang Wanqin, are you still drinking? Time to set up your stall!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Last sip! Be right down!&amp;rdquo;
Lin Song, pulling his flatbed cart, habitually yelled up toward the second floor as he passed the alleyway entrance. He was always the first to arrive. Every day, once his freezer chest was settled in its usual spot, the stalls to his left and right would extend out from it like coordinates, leaving a corridor down the middle of the road for people to walk.</description>

      <description>There was a moderately sized coffee industry exhibition at the International Expo Center over the weekend. Lin Song had long lost his enthusiasm for joining crowds; whether in his daily life or in business, he instinctively resisted excessive exertion.
Lately, however, his business seemed to be turning a corner. As the May weather grew warmer, the coffee shop&amp;rsquo;s losses narrowed. It looked as if with a bit more diligent effort, profitability was within reach.</description>

      <description>The rain from last night, neither too heavy nor too light, had finally ceased before dawn. The air was filled with the damp, earthy smell of the soil, mingled with the unique clamor of a city awakening. The wet asphalt glistened under the sparse streetlights, reflecting a cool, clean light. A news alert popped up on Lin Song&amp;rsquo;s phone: The U.S. had bombed Iran. The world was vast, a stage for distant gunfire and conflict, like a movie that had nothing to do with him.</description>

      <description>In Wuhan, the last ten days of every June are always a time of torrential downpours. It’s as if their frenzied nature has offended the Dragon King; the relentless rain shrouds the city for more than ten days straight.
A thousand years ago, Hankou was still a marsh. In the rainy summers, the wild ducks were happiest. Back then, there was endless rain from the sky and an inexhaustible supply of small fish in the lakes.</description>

      <description>In Lin Song’s childhood memories, summer vacation was intrinsically linked to his grandmother and the fragrance of the earth. Every July, when the school’s white walls were scorched by the blazing sun and the teacher on the podium wrote the final stroke with a piece of chalk to announce the start of the holiday, his heart had already flown to the small village nestled deep in the lake district. His father would always drive the old &amp;ldquo;Jiefang&amp;rdquo; (Liberation) brand truck from his work unit, taking him to his grandmother&amp;rsquo;s doorstep amidst a roaring &amp;ldquo;chug-chug-chug&amp;rdquo; and clouds of dust.</description>

      <description>I pulled out my phone and found Mr. Wang&amp;rsquo;s WeChat. The map showed the location of the café he had recommended. It was over 700 meters from the bus stop, an 8-minute walk. The interview with the café owner was scheduled for 10:30 AM, so I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be late.
Looking Back and Moving Forward This past Tuesday, I finished my barista course at the training school. After the exam next Friday, I&amp;rsquo;ll get my certificate.</description>

      <description>Wuhan had already entered its plum rain season. Even deep into the night, there was no relief from the heat; everything felt damp to the touch. Tossing and turning in bed, Liu Jie would shift his position about every class period&amp;rsquo;s length, a sheen of sweat on his forehead that the constantly blowing fan couldn&amp;rsquo;t disperse.
He regretted not turning on the air conditioner before bed. For a fleeting moment when he was about to sleep, the thought of flipping the AC switch had crossed his mind.</description>

      <description>The currents of history often lay the groundwork for a city&amp;rsquo;s rise in unforeseen ways. In 1369, the second year of the Hongwu reign, the newly enthroned Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang initiated a massive military recruitment in the Huguang region (modern-day Hubei and Hunan provinces) to quell the Ming Xia regime in Sichuan. Two years later, generals Tang He and Fu Youde led this army west, pacifying the region. While the campaigns concluded, a wave of migration had just begun.</description>

      <description>In recent years, the US dollar&amp;rsquo;s position as the world&amp;rsquo;s primary reserve currency and the bedrock of international transactions is facing unprecedented scrutiny and challenges. The dollar, which historically tended to strengthen during periods of economic or geopolitical conflict, has recently exhibited unusual behavior, signaling that a subtle shift might be underway in the international monetary system.
One signal of this change comes from the actions of international rating agencies. Following Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;rsquo;s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating from AAA in 2011, Moody&amp;rsquo;s recently lowered the US government&amp;rsquo;s credit rating from Aaa to Aa1.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ten li of masts leaning against the town, ten thousand households&amp;rsquo; lights bright through the night.&amp;rdquo; This poetic line, quoted in the 1920 Xiakou County Gazetteer, vividly portrays the magnificent scene of Hanzheng Street at its peak prosperity.
Hanzheng Street is one of the oldest streets in Hankou, boasting a history of over five hundred years since its formation. As early as the early Chenghua period of the Ming Dynasty, a change in the course of the Han River made the area adjacent to it a good haven for passing ships, attracting numerous people to build foundations and houses.</description>

      <description>When you leave home punctually from Monday to Friday, take the crowded subway to the busy office, day after day, what you anticipate is the salary your boss pays you each month. Regardless of your skills or how much energy and enthusiasm you invest, the final salary you receive is generally in line with your expectation – not significantly more, nor noticeably less.
With the salary your boss provides, you might treat friends to a special seafood meal when a restaurant has a promotion.</description>

      <guid>https://hankou.com/insights/jianghan-road/</guid>
      <description>Jianghan Road was originally named Guangli Alley, a dirt path about 300 meters long extending from the riverbank to Poyang Street. After Hankou was opened as a treaty port in 1861, the road was widened and paved with gravel, named &amp;ldquo;Taiping Road&amp;rdquo;. By the late Qing Dynasty, Taiping Road had been extended northwards to Hualou Street.
In 1901, Liu Xinsheng, known as Hankou&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Land King&amp;rdquo; or real estate magnate, donated a tract of low-lying land he had acquired through loans, situated around the Zhang Gong Embankment in Hankou, to the then British Concession.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Gold will always shine&amp;rdquo; is a common saying, often cited to encourage harder work, yet it contains a fundamental factual error. Gold itself does not generate light; its glittering appearance is merely the color of light it reflects from external sources. Extending this simple physical fact to the realm of finance might offer a deeper understanding of gold&amp;rsquo;s nature as a special asset: the radiance of its value doesn&amp;rsquo;t stem from intrinsic growth or yield, but rather largely reflects external conditions – the market&amp;rsquo;s fear, the shadow of risk, the tide of currency, the temperature of geopolitics.</description>

      <description>The Jianghan Customs House is one of the most representative landmark buildings in Wuhan, located at 129 Yanjiang Avenue. The building&amp;rsquo;s east-facing main entrance faces the Yangtze River, while its main structure runs parallel to Yanjiang Avenue.
Its history traces back to 1861. According to Article 10 of the Treaty of Tianjin between China and Britain, the British government compelled the Qing government to open Zhenjiang, Jiujiang, and Hankou as foreign trade ports and establish customs houses.</description>

      <description>Berkshire Hathaway&amp;rsquo;s annual shareholder meeting is famously dubbed the &amp;ldquo;Woodstock of Capitalism.&amp;rdquo; However, unlike the original Woodstock music festival which took place only once in the distant year of 1968 (when Buffett was 38 and had acquired Berkshire just three years prior), Buffett&amp;rsquo;s gathering is a yearly event. How much value does this enduring &amp;ldquo;Woodstock of Capitalism&amp;rdquo; truly hold, and is that value adequately reflected in Berkshire Hathaway&amp;rsquo;s stock price?</description>

      <description>Bill Gates has announced plans to permanently close his founded Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation by December 31, 2045. This decision significantly accelerates the pace of his philanthropic work. Compared to the original plan of gradually closing the foundation within 20 years after the deaths of Bill and Melinda, Gates chose to move the closure forward to 2045 to ensure funds are directed faster towards the world&amp;rsquo;s most pressing needs. He stated, &amp;ldquo;I have decided to return virtually all of my wealth to society faster than planned because there are too many urgent problems in the world that can&amp;rsquo;t wait.</description>

      <description>Wuhan consists of three towns, namely Hanyang, Wuchang and Hankou.
Hanyang and Hankou face each other across the Han River. Among the three towns, Hanyang was established the earliest. Since the Tang Dynasty, Hanyang County has begun to govern the affairs in Hubei. Wuchang and Hankou face each other across the river. Wuchang originally referred to the current Ezhou area. After the Yuan Dynasty, it was precisely pointed to the current location of Wuchang City.</description>

Many consulates in Hankou are usually concentrated in Jianghan District, Jiangan District and other areas, which are all part of the traditional Hankou area.</description>

The immortal who rode the yellow crane has long since departed,
Only the Yellow Crane Tower stands here still.
The yellow crane, once gone, has never returned,
For a thousand years, the white clouds idly drift on.
In the clear river&amp;rsquo;s view, Hanyang&amp;rsquo;s trees stand distinct,
On Parrot Isle, lush grasses grow thick and green.
Where is my homeland at sunset?
The river&amp;rsquo;s mist and waves stir sorrow in the soul.</description>
