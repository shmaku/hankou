    <p>The Wuhan Meteorological Observatory upgraded its high-temperature warning to a red alert, with some streets reaching over 41°C (106°F). Lin Song felt like a frog being boiled in water; after being cooked for so long, he had learned to swim in it.
On days when the sun beat down, Lin Song would go out wearing a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and a hat, after smearing a layer of sunscreen on his face and the back of his neck. He kept a bottle of sunscreen spray in his car year-round—a waterproof, sport-type spray that felt greasy on his arms and reflected the sunlight.

    <p>Lin Song was often criticized for not doing housework. “Sigh, when it comes to anything, you just can’t rely on others.” “Tonight, you’re making your own dinner.” “Believe it or not, I’ll spill the coffee in your cup! All you know how to do every day is make coffee for yourself.”
When Lin Song was little, the leftovers on the table had to be covered with gauze food covers to keep the flies away. The now-extinct fly swatter was once a must-have in every home; almost everyone had one.

    <p>Even in the sweltering heat of midsummer, there can be cool mornings. The early-rising sun was blocked by the tall buildings to the east. In the community’s courtyard, a through-draft blew from north to south, wandering between the apartment buildings and the small woods.
Though it was long past his usual breakfast time, Lin Song wasn’t hungry at all. All told, sixteen hours had passed since last night’s dinner. Perhaps due to the heat, he still had no appetite.

    <p>Lin Song believes he is the most ill-tempered man in all of Hankou.
But living in Wuhan, what can you do? The winter is cold enough to freeze your scalp; the summer is hot enough to agitate you from the inside out. As for flying into these nameless rages, Lin Song feels it’s completely beyond his control.
He remembers Wu Meili once telling him:
“I’m not the kind of person who is nice to others for no reason. You are good to me first, and then I will be good to you. If you want me to be good to you first, there’s no way.”

    <p>In 2023, a 45-year-old Brazilian businessman named Hugo Farias set a Guinness World Record by completing 366 marathons in a row. Yes, he did it on purpose—one more than the 365 days in a year.
“I gave up a stable career to pursue a completely unknown goal,” he said.
From the news, it’s clear that Hugo is a successful businessman. But in Lin Song’s view, successful businessmen don’t pursue completely unknown goals. As the saying goes, “Success comes from preparation; failure comes from lack thereof.”

    <p>Just three hours ago, Christian Horner resigned from his position as Team Principal and CEO of the Oracle Red Bull Racing team, effective immediately, exiting the F1 team. Twenty years, 405 races, 141 championship titles—eight drivers’ championships, six constructors’ championships. He was the longest-serving team principal in Red Bull’s history.
An era has completely ended.
Last year, Verstappen secured the drivers’ championship for Red Bull, but the constructors’ title was snatched by McLaren. The Thai and Austrian sides of Red Bull have been in constant dispute over control of the F1 team.

The printer rattles off orders from Ele.me, and the ice machine is completely empty.

    <p>Lin Song had absolutely no intention of going out.
Even in the morning, the coolest part of the day, the glaring sunlight outside his curtains made him feel an invisible wave of heat.
Summer is like that. You never feel hungry. Even if your empty stomach rumbles, you have no desire to eat. A couple of sips of water make you feel better.
But not wanting to eat is just an illusion created by the sweltering heat. Lin Song rationally reminded himself that it was almost noon, and the task of combining two meals into one still needed to be done.

    <p>They say today is the end of the world. And so, the 39-degree heat of Wuhan’s summer arrived especially early.
The weather in Wuhan today: 39 degrees Celsius. Don’t ask. Wuhan’s weather is only ever allowed to be 39 degrees. Even if the sun in the sky were to fall on your face, the temperature would still only be permitted to be 39 degrees.
At a time like this, if you dared to go out under the sun and lick a utility pole by the road, you’d hear a sizzle, and your tongue would be seared.

    <p>Lin Song took out his phone and found his instructor, Mr. Zhou, on WeChat. The map showed the location of the coffee shop he had recommended. It was over 700 meters from the bus stop, an eight-minute walk. His interview with the coffee shop owner was scheduled for 10:30 AM; he should be on time.
This past Tuesday, he had finished his barista course at the training school. After the exam next Friday, he would receive his graduation certificate. Learning to make bread and coffee, he thought, was far more interesting than preparing for the Gaokao. The funny thing was, even the instructors sometimes messed up, and you could actually laugh in class—something that was never allowed back in his high school.
