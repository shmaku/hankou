Please take special precautions.”\nIt seemed the observatory could no longer afford to be subtle, skipping the 38°C warning line to announce a truth everyone knew even without a forecast: some areas would exceed 41°C.\nIf you dare to make history, I dare to witness it.\nLin Song’s attitude toward the heatwave has become exceptionally calm. The Earth revolves around the sun in an elliptical orbit, sometimes closer, sometimes farther, so the weather will naturally have its cold and hot spells. When faced with extreme heat or cold, hiding is more important than anything else.\nTian Meili always carries an umbrella when she goes out, regardless of whether it’s raining. Shielding herself from the ubiquitous UVA and UVB rays is far more critical than blocking the rain.\nShe often goes to the mall to cool off. After breakfast, she wanders around for a couple of hours, then heads to the supermarket to buy some fruits and vegetables. Occasionally, while enjoying the mall’s air conditioning, a wave of anxiety hits her: Did I turn off the AC at home before I left?\nThroughout the afternoon, Lin Song was in a daze, debating whether to cook dinner. He scrolled through his phone, pondering: “Are there any leftovers in the fridge?” “Two dishes from yesterday. A tomato and egg stir-fry would be enough.” “Oh, wait, we agreed to go to Cha Gang for shrimp dumplings tonight.” “Should we drive to dinner then?” “If we’re not drinking, of course, we’ll drive.” “Come to think of it, it’s been a long time since I had a drink.” “If we drive, Cha Gang probably doesn’t offer parking validation. Better not to drive.” “We could park on the street by the mall entrance tonight; no one should be giving out tickets.”\nAs children, we all played cops and robbers. Whether you were a cop or a robber, you always needed some cover, either hiding in the park’s bushes or behind a classroom door.\nAs we slowly grew up, to cope with exams and career promotions, we developed a survival skill: constantly finding things to put in front of ourselves as a shield. Prioritizing the self, the goal is that in a complex environment, “I can see you, but you can’t fully see me.”\nWe pretend to be hardworking, pretend to be happy, pretend to care, thinking we can do it without a trace. However, most of the time, the people watching your performance are just pretending not to know. By concealing yourself, you inevitably blur your own view of the world.\nNo matter how slow a person’s reaction is, they can understand the sharpness of a paper cutter. Once you’ve been cut by a sharp blade, you remember it forever.\nIn everyone’s childhood memories, there are a few incidents: bumping your head on the corner of a table, or knocking over a cup of hot water in your father’s hand. These painful memories often last a long time. As the saying goes, “once bitten by a snake, ten years shy of a rope,” we constantly waver between self-doubt and blind confidence. The longer you live, the faster you hide when trouble arises.\nChoosing to pay for hot dry noodles with your Alipay balance in the morning doesn’t mean you don’t like to buy a bowl of beef noodle soup with Huabei (a credit feature). It’s just like the advertisement on the mall wall: “Yesterday’s ‘satisfaction’ could be today’s ‘disappointment’.”\nThe fearless will always choose to be running on the road. What magnificent transformations must the world undergo to satisfy their fascination with the kaleidoscope? Three mirrors enclose colorful scraps of paper; as long as it keeps spinning, the changing colors are endless.\nAlthough it is difficult for a blind person to cross the street, when they stand at one end of a crosswalk, even if they cannot see the traffic lights, they can judge whether it is safe to cross by the frequency of the “tick-tock” signal.\nA teddy bear is a child’s toy. No one would be foolish enough to keep a brown bear at home, because everyone understands that a real bear is dangerous to be with.\nStop playing hide-and-seek with the world. Is there really anything left to hide behind? The most effective way to avoid being found is to not participate in the game at all.\n",
