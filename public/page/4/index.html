    <p>He left the house too early, his morning appetite not yet awakened. Lin Song went to the Dehua Restaurant to get two orders of xiao long bao and two fried eggs, drizzling some light soy sauce over the yolks. He took the food with him in the car, ready to comfort his hollow stomach whenever hunger decided to strike.
In the summer, it seems human skin can perform photosynthesis. As long as you give it some water, you can go all day without thinking about food. The afternoon is when children are supposed to take their naps; summer afternoons are sweltering and boring. The TV stations no longer loop reruns of My Fair Princess or Journey to the West, so children can take advantage of their grandparents’ naptime to scroll through all sorts of videos on their phones.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>At noon, Chen Peisi’s star power failed to draw a larger audience for his film, The Stage. Screening Room No. 2, located near the ticket check, is one of the larger theaters in the cinema. Even so, there were fewer people in the audience than there were opera fans in the movie itself. After accounting for the couple who walked out midway, the vast theater felt even more sparse.
The film’s original score left little impression, mainly because The Stage is set against the backdrop of the Peking Opera classic Farewell My Concubine, and thus, most of the film’s music was occupied by traditional opera melodies. The choice of lyrics for the closing credits song—Wang Anshi’s poem, To the Tune of Gui Zhi Xiang: Musing on the Past at Jinling—was quite an elegant touch. Its final line, “To this day, the singing girls still from time to time perform the songs of a fallen dynasty,” could perhaps be gifted to those film critics incapable of understanding the movie.

Back in middle school, he’d wear the same jersey for an entire afternoon of ball games, and after practice, he’d just toss it in the equipment room, only to put it on again the next afternoon. It was an age of utter indifference.

    <p>The best legacy a restaurant that has closed for good can leave to a shopping mall is its wide assortment of tables and chairs. The vacated stalls can’t find new tenants right away, so they become temporary leisure areas. On this hot summer day, in an air-conditioned mall, as long as there are enough seats, there will be enough customers coming to escape the heat.
The grandpas and grandmas, brothers and sisters who come to enjoy the cool, bring their cell phones and occupy every empty seat. If a bench hidden behind a barricade is wide enough, lying down for an hour or two is also a fine option. A small personal bag for a pillow, and you have a perfect afternoon.

    <p>After raining for half the night, it finally stopped. The east-facing window did not greet an early-rising sun. The air was clear and transparent. Along the horizon, thick cumulonimbus clouds curled, letting a faint morning glow seep through.
Room 7 on the sixth floor is being renovated. Debris from dismantled old cabinets litters the elevator. You have to watch your step coming in and out to avoid a nail. Just after 8:30 a.m., the impact drill started, sending vibrations through the entire building and giving me a headache. I had to hurry downstairs to get “guò zǎo” (the Wuhan term for the morning ritual of eating breakfast).

    <p>As night fell, Wuhan, having passed the “Minor Heat” solar term, was somehow less scorching.
The clouds in the sky were always piled thick, clump after clump, like sun umbrellas, blocking the sun from time to time. Occasionally, at dusk, the heavens would bestow a stingy shower, taming some of the fierce heat of the scalding asphalt roads.
The shelves outside the HotMaxx discount store were diligently displaying all kinds of beer. A 500ml can of Budweiser, nearing its expiration date, sold for only 4 yuan. There were no 330ml cans in the promotion, which seemed to suggest that people’s starting volume for beer consumption had seen a substantial increase. Although he rarely drank anymore, Linsong still bought a case. Even if he didn’t drink it, just having it chilled in the fridge and seeing the pile of beer every time he opened the door felt cooling.

I vaguely remember the last time was in Hong Kong. I had left a Bob Dylan concert early, otherwise I wouldn’t have made it to the Mount Davis Youth Hostel before its reception closed.
The old driver asked, bewildered, why I chose to stay on the mountain. “It’s cheap there.” “It’s about the same in the city, there are hotels everywhere. Factoring in this taxi fare, it’s not worth it.” Indeed, the taxi fare that night was more expensive than a night at the youth hostel.

    <p>Friday afternoon was utterly exhausting. The client’s warehouse closed at five, so there was no time to deliver the prepped goods. After a quick discussion with the client, they agreed to a Saturday morning delivery. One final confirmation: yes, the client’s warehouse accepts deliveries on Saturdays.
Coming out of the underground garage, Lin Song slipped on his sunglasses while waiting at a red light to make a U-turn.
The barrier for the U-turn lane extended nearly to the middle of the intersection. Why not make it shorter? It was only after turning the car and climbing onto the ramp that he understood: if the barrier wasn’t extended, cars turning too early might hit the ramp’s guardrail.

    <p>The Wuhan Meteorological Observatory upgraded its high-temperature warning to a red alert, with some streets reaching over 41°C (106°F). Lin Song felt like a frog being boiled in water; after being cooked for so long, he had learned to swim in it.
On days when the sun beat down, Lin Song would go out wearing a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and a hat, after smearing a layer of sunscreen on his face and the back of his neck. He kept a bottle of sunscreen spray in his car year-round—a waterproof, sport-type spray that felt greasy on his arms and reflected the sunlight.

When Lin Song was little, the leftovers on the table had to be covered with gauze food covers to keep the flies away. The now-extinct fly swatter was once a must-have in every home; almost everyone had one.
